Max Subarray

Given an array and an integer k, find the maximum for each and every contigious subarray of size k.

Sample Input:
N = 9
arr[] = { 1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6 }
k = 3

Sample Output:
3 3 4 5 5 5 6

First attempt: 
Brute force: For every index i we have a k size window
and we can iterate over k size window in linear time 
to find out which is the maximum element
T.C.: O(N * k)

Second attempt:
Sliding window:
k size window we can add another element and deduct the first element
