Stack Recap:
Push - O(1), Pop - O(1) and Top - O(1)
Stack comes in two places :
1) Doing Recursive Functions(implicit stack which is the call stack)
2) We can use stack as a standalone Data Structure that is the explicit stack
Example: Balls inside a bottle will come out in LIFO manner
Stack is LIFO Data Structure.
We push and pop from Top. We can access the top of stack.

Queue Recap:
It is FIFO Data Structure
EnQueue - O(1), DeQueue - O(1) and Front - O(1)
Example: ATM Queue person who joined the queue first will get the cash earlier than someone who came later.
We EnQueue from rear and DeQueue from Front
We can check which element / data is there at Front.

Deque Recap:
Insertion from front and back
Insertion from back is push_back
Insertion from front is push_front
Front part is visible.
We can use sliding window in this.

Comments:
-> Stacks and Queue are used as a helpful data structures in many other problems
-> Less variety on standalone problems
-> Iterative solutions to recursive problems can be written using stack
-> Problems involving trees and graphs make extensive use of Queue especially traversals like BFS / Level Order.
