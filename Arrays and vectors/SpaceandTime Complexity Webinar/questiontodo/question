take array of size 10 then make it 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000.
Run the merge sort and then the bubble sort program on local IDE because online ide takes lot of time.
Note time taken for each value of n and then we will realise bubble sort is proportional to nsquare
and for for merge sort it is nlogn
The inbuilt sort is faster than the other merge and quick sort hence obviosuly faster than bubble sort.
