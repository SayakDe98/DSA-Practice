1) Clarify the problem. We can re ask the question if we don't understand. We can write it down.
The person who attended the interview asked: could there be -ve numbers or floating point numbers.
The answer of that question changes the outcome of the code.
2)Before writing the solution we should think out loud constantly.
By doing that the interviewer can course correct you to the direction of the question 
they were asking or to feed off that and ask you more questions that will help you
demonstrate your knowledge even further because they have said something that I can expand upon.
This will help us work out the problem. Two minds are better than one.
He thought out loud before writing the code.
At first not the best solution came to his mind.
The interviewer might ask you to make your solution better : faster and/or using less memory.
Ultimately when you think both are at a place where we can code it then start coding it.
Next good thing is we should have some test cases.
Like in this interviewer the interviewer gave two sample test cases:
[1,2,3,9],sum=8 and [1,2,4,4],sum=8
If interviewer doesn't give test case then make one up.
Then think of edge cases.
In the sample interview he tested an empty collection which is very good to think about.
