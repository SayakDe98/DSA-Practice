Detect Cycle in a Linked List
Yes, a Linked List may contain a Cycle! See this example below, where the last node instead of pointing to a NULL points to some middle node of the linked list.



Your task is to write a function, that returns true/false depending upon whether the linked contains a cycle or not!

Do you need hints?
Hint - 1 Think ðŸ¤” using Runner Technique - Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)
Hint - 2 If they enter inside the loop, they will match at some point.

If you want to break the loop, read about Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm.
