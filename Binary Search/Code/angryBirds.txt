Angry Birds:
There is a long wire along at straight line, which contains N bird nests at positions x1, x2, ..., xN.

There are B(B <= N) birds, which become angry towards
each other once put into a nest. To put the birds from hurting each other you want to assign birds to nests such
that minimum distance between any two birds is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

We can apply binary search here.
Any search space which is non increasing or it is non decreasing is monotonic search space and we can apply binary search on it.

Input:
N = 5 nests/stalls
B = 3 birds
Nests are at location: [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]

Output: 3

Approach 1: Brute Force.
NcB options. where c is combination.

Approach 2: For binary search we need monotonic space,
here search space is the distance since we need to find out the distance hence it is the search space
min. possible distance between  2 birds = 0 if we put birds in same nest
max. possible distance between 2 birds = end index - start index.

Can we apply binarySearch in this search space ? Answer: Yes

if s = 0, e = 8 
then mid = ( 8 + 0 ) / 2 = 4
can we make a distribution such that min. distance between 2 birds is atleast 4

we place first bird at 1 then for 2nd bird we place it at 8 but we don't have place for 3rd bird

previously we had min distance = 4 so we reduce our search space to 0 to 4 distance because it can't be greater than 4 for 3 birds and we have monotonic search space
now new mid = ( 0 + 4 ) / 2 = 2
we can place birds with min. distance = 2
1, 4, 8 are the place where we can place the three birds
we want to maximize our answer so we need to discard the left part
so start = 2, end = 4
mid = (2 + 4) / 2 = 3
1, 4, 8 are the places where we place birds
largest distance  = 3 because 4 isn't possible.
