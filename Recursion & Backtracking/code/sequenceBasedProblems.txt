Find subset of a given string:
Given a string find all the subsets of given string.

input:
abc
output:
"", a,b,c,ab,ac,bc,abc

For a string of length N there are going to be 2^N subsets.
For each letter we have two options so we multiple 2 n times we get 8 options.
subset also means subsequence. but it is not a substring.
substring is continuous part of array whereas a subsequence can be discontinuous.
In string abc -> ac is subsequence but not substring

Let's start with an empty string then we can include a or exlclude a  that is "" or a
