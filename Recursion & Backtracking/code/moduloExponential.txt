Modulo Exponentiation
You are given two numbers a and b, your task is to compute a raised to power b.

As this value can be very large compute it to modulo 1000000007.



HINT : Use Modulo Properties

(m * n) % p has a very interesting property: 
(m * n) % p =((m % p) * (n % p)) % p
Expected Time Complexity:

O(log b)

Input Format:

In the function, 2 integers a and b are passed.

Output Format:

Return a single integer which is equivalent to (a^b) modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:

1<=a,b<=50

Sample Testcase:

Input:

5 3

Output:

125
