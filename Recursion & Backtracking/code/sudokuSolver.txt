Sudoku Solver
Given a partially filled Sudoku matrix of 9x9,
write a function to fill the matrix using sudoku rules.
Input:
2D Matrix.

Output:
Solved 2D matrix

Let's assume all those elements which are empty are 0's and we need
to replace 0's with valid integers from 1 to 9 according to sudoku rules
in a 9*9grid every row should contain a number from 1 to 9, 
every column should contain a number from 1 to 9 as well.
Every sub grid which is 3 x 3 sub grid should also contain number from 1 to 9
No number should repeat either in row or column or sub grid

How to try out all possibilites?
Stop when we get one valid solution
we can check from left to right or from top to bottom
If cells are prefilled then don't change, then go to next cell
If a cell isn't filled then make a recursive call on the subgridin which we haven't checked so far

Try out all possible solutions->1 valid solution
Check if a number can be placed. doesn't occur in row+ col, subgrid then place it.
check for(number in range 1 to 9)
if number can be placed then arr[i][j] = number
solve (i, j + 1)
try next if solve returns false otherwise return true
corner case: if j == 9 then we go to next row, i.e.: i = i + 1, j = 0
finally if  i = 9 then return true because this problem can be solved.

if we have tried all the numbers then go back and change some other cell. Make that cell 0 and return false.
