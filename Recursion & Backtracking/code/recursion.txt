Recursion is the process of defining a problem
(or the solution to a problem) in terms of(a simpler version of) itself.

We have a problem of size n we reduce it to size n / 2
then it can be reduced to size n / 4 and so on... this is Recursion

Recursion occurs in depth first manner. Calls are done in left to right order

For Recursion we must have a base case and then recursive case.
For example if we want to define an operation "Go to Home" then we do:
Base case: If you are at home stop moving.
1)Recursive case: Take one step toward home.
2)"Go to Home".

Code:

void goToHome(int x, int Home) {
    if(x == Home) {
        print("Reached Home");
        return; 
    }

    x = x + 1;
    goToHome(x, Home);
}

int main() {
    int x = 1;// x is current position
    int Home = 10;//Home is end goal

    goToHome(x, Home);

    return 0;
}

Recursion = Principal of Mathematical Induction
1. Figure of the smallest case.

2. Always assume the subproblem can be solved.

3. Solve the current problem assuming sub problem solution exists.
