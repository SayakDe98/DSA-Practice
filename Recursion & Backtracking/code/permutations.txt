Permutations
Given a string s, find all permutations of the string.

Input: abc
Output: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba

Firstly, let's keep a at the first place and find permutations of the smaller string bc
Secondly, keep b at the first place and find permutations of the smaller string ac
Thirdly, keep c at first place and permuation of smaller string ab

for a we have abc, acb
for b we have bac or bca
for c we have cab or cba

If we don't modify our array while going back we will end up getting wrong result
WHile going back we should restore our original array, this is called backtracking.
A B C 
replace A with A, then A with B, then A with C and permute rest of the stuff.
            A,B,c
        A | BC 
    AB|C  AC|B 
ABC         ACB 
If we hit base case we print it. Everytime we go back we undo changes.
