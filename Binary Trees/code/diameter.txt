Find the diameter of the binary tree, diameter is defined as the largest distance between any two nodes of the tree.
For the binary tree:
               1
        2              3
    4     5                  6
        7
The diamter of the binary tree is 5 since distance between 7 and 6 is furthest which is 5

Diameter may or may not pass through root, i.e., diameter may lie completely in a subtree

How to generalise it then?
1st case: D1, Diameter passes through the root. For this we can add maximum height of right subtree and maximum height of left subtree add them to get the diameter.
2nd case: D2, Diameter lies in left subtree
3rd case: D3, Diameter lies in right subtree
D2 and D3 are defined recursively. D1 is what is you compute using H1 and H2

If root is NULL then diameter = 0, else d1 = h1 + h2, d2 = diam (root->left),d3=diam(root->right)
d=max(d1,d2,d3);return d;
we are doing post order traversal.
