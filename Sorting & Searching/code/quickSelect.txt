We did sorting using quick sort now let's use this
technique(partition) to search an element.

Write a function that takes input an array of distinct
integers and returns kth smallest in the array.

Sample Input:
[10, 5, 2, 0, 7, 6, 4]
k = 4

Sample Output:
5

technique 1: do sorting and find kth smallest ele
technique 2: do heap and find kth smallest ele

arr[pivot] = 4
and we have 2,0 as unsorted array and 5,7,10,6 as unsorted array

Let's assume 4 is in its correct position
and its position = 3

we see we don't need to sort the left part because there are elements lesser than k
so we need to call quicksort on right part of array

so either we will go either in left part or in right part

when we do quicksort in left part we see 6 is at position 5

we need k = 4 so we will make a call on left part that is 5 then we get k = 4 's value
