Concept of merge sort:
Input array: [10, 5, 2, 0, 7, 6, 4]
Sorted array: [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10]

step 1: Divide array into two parts. Divide about mid point

            array
           /     \
        10, 5,   0, 7, 6,
        2        4
(start to mid)   (mid + 1 to end)
step 2: merge sort(left) and merge sort(right)
we get 2,5,10 and 0,4,6,7

step 3: merge the left and right parts into single array.
we need two pointers i pointer which points to lowest value of left sorted array and j which points to lowest value of right sorted array
we will compare value at i & j which ever is smaller we put into new array

now we copy back these elements into original array.
This uses divide and conquer algo.
